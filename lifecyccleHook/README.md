hooks are react functions components that allow a little state via functions. Pure function components
are stateless but you can get a lot more functionality by adding a "little" state to function components. 

Hook framework: 
1) useState(initial_state) hook allow function components to access state wo turning it into a class
useState returns 2 items, the current state and a function that updates it. 
2) useEffect()
