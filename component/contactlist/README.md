display a list which comes from some JS datastruture

the convention is to put an array into brackets like {arr} which  displays the contents of arr. this has
to be inside a div or some high level component/html/jsx element
this is convenient because the result of a map or filter operation returns an array
we can specify obj.map(something) which returns an array.
