DEMO controlled component using state in component, forms are CC. 
how to use onChange, how to update state in component from UI change
add: is there onXXX which should be same as onChange? 

Controlled Components: 
a component where the component controls the state of a user input. A common use is an input box
or form. This can be controlled in react via the React ref system which creates a global pointer(check) to allow
components access to input data. The controlled component method pre hooks is to put the state variable in the 
component into the input HTML via JSX. This is the example here.  


**Task**: Edit the code to make the printed text mirror what we type into the input
field. When we erase all of the text, nothing should be printed to the screen.

Remember that the React component that renders the form also controls what
happens in that form on user input.

This exercise will help you solidify what you've learned about Controlled Components.
