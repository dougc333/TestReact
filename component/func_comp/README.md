functional components, they dont hold state. convention is to have function name capitalized
functional components dont inherit from Component
funcional compoents dont use this but use props

1) oldindex.js shows a functional component needs to have first capital letter
2) refactor contactlist app to use functional components
each component should be in a separate file like OO design
