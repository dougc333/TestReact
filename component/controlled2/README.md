### Instructions

This file gives you a functioning app. But, as you can tell, the App
isn't modular at all - there is only 1 component!

**Task**: Break down this app into components and make them work together to achieve
exactly the same result.

Remember that React components should be modular, composable (can be assembled in various

This exercise will help you to practice passing data into components, creating
Stateless Functional Components, adding state to components, updating state, and
creating Controlled Components.
